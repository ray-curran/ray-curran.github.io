* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?  
  It took me a while to distinguished between these items. Borders were a little easier for me since I'd usually only use them to show me where certain elements started/ended or where they were sitting in relation to others. I ended up using margins to move most of the elements where I wanted on the page and then padding to add a little more buffer to elements that felt squished. 

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?  
  I learned that it can be quite difficult to perfect. I had built a few sites using bootstrap in the past, which made it much easier to space items next to each other and determine where they sat. This was much more difficult having to guess/check a little bit. After I realized I could use Chrome DevTools to make this step quicker it was much easier. 

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?  
  The easiest aspect was setting colors for different aspects of the pages. The most difficult was just trying to make elements go exactly where I wanted them to. I had to really know what each of the css elements I was changing did, since I seemed to be undoing some of the work I had done previously at times. 

* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?  
  I learned that you really need to know what you're doing. Just changing a bunch of items and hoping for the best is a recipe for frustration and disaster. Often finding out what task you're trying to complete and then searching for that in google helped a lot.
