            <p>
                Iâ€™m a web developer with several years of project management experience in the Healthcare IT industry. I care deeply about the teams I am a part of and take pride in always putting my full self into my work. As I navigate through life, I always aim to focus on personal connections and find new challenges to continue my personal growth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working in my last job, I divided my time between designing an optimal user experience for healthcare providers and finding ways to use existing software to solve new problems in the clinical setting. After realizing I had a knack for the technical aspect of the position and a passion for an enhanced user experience, I started self-teaching myself Ruby and Javascript before applying to Dev Bootcamp. I know this was the right step for me and my interest in programming has only grown since the program began.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now that I have the tools to become a developer, I am excited to find more problems to solve in the next step of my career. The continuous support of the tech community has me looking forward to each new hurdle I can overcome.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time, you may find me:
            </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Traveling: most recently, camped and hiked through 15 national parks in the summer of 2015</li>
                        <li>Cooking: currently struggling to master the art of fresh pasta making, past projects have been focused on slow cooking</li>
                        <li>Swimming: after a long hiatus since high school, I've rediscovered the pool now that I'm back in Chicago</li>
                    </ul>
            <p>
                There's plenty more to tell, and if you'd like to know more, feel free to reach out to me at rpcurr@gmail.com.
