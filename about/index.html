            <p>
                Ray grew up in a small suburb of Chicago called Orland Hills. After high school, he moved to the East coast to go to college at Boston University and study Public Health and Management. 
            </p>
            <p>
                After school, he was drawn back to the Midwest and accepted a job as an implementation consultant at a Healthcare IT company called Epic in Madison, WI. During this timeframe, he completed some self-study and developed his newfound interest in coding. He finally decided to take the leap and sign up for Dev Bootcamp to turn his hobby into a potential career.

                        <li>Cooking: currently struggling to master the art of fresh pasta making, past projects have been focused on slow cooking</li>
                        <li>Swimming: after a long hiatus since high school, he's rediscovered the pool now that he's back in Chicago</li>
                    </ul>
