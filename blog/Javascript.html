        <h2>Ruby vs. JavaScript</h2>
        <h3>January 3, 2016</h3>
        <article>
            <p>
            	It's a brand new year, and I'm back with brand new information about what I've been learning at Dev BootCamp this past couple weeks. Since I'm sure everyone is working hard on their resolutions I'll try to keep it short and sweet. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Last week I wrote about Ruby classes, which are like blueprints for objects. This type of thing is so useful that other object-oriented programming languages have similar functions. This week we'll take a look at one: JavaScript's constructor notation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	First let's go through a quick refresher on Ruby classes. Feel free to take a look at my dog example below. When we create a new class, we always need to use the class keyword and create an initialize method that defines instance variables. The instance variables start with the @ symbol to quickly reference what type of variable they are. If we want to define a method, you just need to use the def keyword like you would outside of a class. Finally, when creating a new object using the class, you just need to name the object and write ClassName.new along with whatever arguments are needed. 
            </p>
            <pre><code>
class Dog
  def initialize(name, breed)
    @name = name
    @breed = breed
  end

  def dog_type
    puts "#{@name} is a #{@breed}."
  end
end

cody = Dog.new("Cody", "Pit Bull")
cody.dog_type
# Output: Cody is a Pit Bull. 
            </pre></code>
            <p>
            	That seemed pretty straightforward, right? Maybe you're even starting to feel comfortable creating classes and objects using those classes. Now is the perfect time to throw a wrench into that comfort. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	As I mentioned earlier, many other coding languages do things like this. JavaScript, for example, uses constructor notation to perform a similar function. Unfortunately, the syntax is a different in a few distinct ways. I've rewritten the Dog class below, but this time I've formatted it using JavaScript's constructors. Try to find a couple differences and similarities before reading on. 
            </p>
            <pre><code>
function Dog(name, breed) {
  this.name = name;
  this.breed = breed;
  this.dog_type = function () {
    console.log(this.name + " is a " + this.breed);
  }
};

var cody = new Dog("Cody", "Pit Bull");
cody.dog_type();
            </pre></code>
            <p>
              Let's break this down now. A lot of this looks familiar. When creating the constructor, you still need to list arguments between parentheses in the first line. These can be used throughout the class definition. We also need to pass these arguments to instance variables later on. Even the dog_type function, which looks a little different syntactically, looks familiar in its concatenation. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	If this is your first time seeing some of these items, this still may seem a little foreign, so we can translate some of these pieces from Ruby to JavaScript. First off, notice that instead of the class keyword we used in Ruby, we use the more generic function keyword in JavaScript. Secondly, when defining instance variables and functions specific to this constructor, we need to use the this keyword instead of using the @ symbol that we saw in Ruby. The this keyword makes sure that each object created using the Dog constructor has access to the instance variables and functions within it. Finally, notice that creating an object from the constructor is a little different as well. Instead of using the "Dog.new" we saw in Ruby, we can just write new Dog and pass our arguments in. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Like I said earlier, these notations certainly have their similarities and differences. The key is translating each into whatever makes sense to you (and more importantly, making sure you know when to use which). Mastering each of these will certainly take time, but I hope this was a decent intro!
