              Hi All! First off, thanks for reading. I am just starting off in this wide world of coding, so here I'll be giving some brief descriptions of what's going one each week. 
            </p>
            <p>
            One of the first things I took on this week was version control. There are several benefits to using version control. In my mind, it seems to do a lot of the work for you. Rather than having to manually track every single change you make to your code, the system will do it and it allows you to save all your collected actions via commits. Version control also allows you to have a type of redo or backtrack if something does go wrong. Rather than having to manually back items out and find out what went wrong, version control allows you to revert back to a previous working system and then test the items that might be incorrect later on. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This week I started using the version control management system known as git. git is free software that helps keep track of any changes you make to your system or project. Whenever I was creating or editing any files within my projects or repositories, git was able to quickly tell me what changes I made. This made my life much easier. Once I was happy with the new or edited file in my project, I was able to add them to a staging area. This area is for files that I'm pretty confident are ready to be moved into the project, but I still may have some additional changes to make before I move it in. After all my changes for that feature or session are complete, I can commit all the changes in the staging area. Committing is like a formal save point where I'm confident that all my changes should work together. When I commit anything, I will also need to write a commit message, which tells anyone else (or me if I forget) what I did and why I did it that way. If I later find out that a particular feature I edited is acting up, I can quickly scan through commit messages to find the one that I probably changed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            While git is a great tool to use on your own when you're creating and editing a project, it can be hard to share your work with others or look at changes in a visually pleasing way. To solve these problems, I've been using GitHub, which is an online host that integrates with git. Rather than only storing your git projects on your local machine, you can use GitHub to collaborate on projects with others and be working on one larger project all at the same time. Each team member can have their own branch or be working on a different feature, and then when they are all pulled back into the GitHub repository, different users can review work done by the others. This way, not only are you able to quickly and easily collaborate, but someone else gets their eyes on the exact changes that were made before they are merged back into your overall master branch. GitHub is also generally more easy to navigate when there is a lot of data to go through. If I wanted to review several hundred commit messages for a large project, I'd rather do that in GitHub than scroll through the pages of them in git. 
        </p>

            Anyways, that's all for this week. Check in again later for more exciting developments!
