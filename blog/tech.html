            	As I finish up my last couple weeks of remote work, I figured it'd be a good time to start looking forward into what I'll be learning in the coming phases. One of the primary things (I think) I'll be focusing on is Ruby on Rails. I've had a couple people ask me what this is when I tell them, and haven't had a totally concrete answer. Now seems like a great time to fix that!
            </p>
            <p>
            	First off, let's cover what Rails actually is. Based on the "Ruby on Rails" title that people use to refer to it, you'd probably assume it has something to do with Ruby, and you'd be absolutely right. Rails is a web application framework that was built using the Ruby language. It's actually just a Ruby library that has its own conventions and tools. Let's dig into some of the specifics that make Rails stand out among other languages. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	Rails is a language that really pushes a DRY (don't repeat yourself) framework. When I was doing my research this confused me a little bit, since DRY seems to be more of a programmer decision as they're writing code. The way Rails is set up, however, makes this a little different. Rails has some parts that are already set up and built in the background. If you know what they are and how to use them appropriately, you can skip over parts of code that you previously had to manually write out. This brings me to my next point. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	The pre-set parts of the system I mentioned above are called conventions, and Rails has a general mindset of "convention over configuration". This means that if you understand these conventions, you don't have to specify them later on. Parts of the system that make sense, like "person" objects being saved in the "people" table don't need to be manually up. You can spend more time creating parts of your program that are unique rather than doing meaningless setup.
            </p>
            <p>
            	Since the conventions are in place, Rails applications end up being built very quickly and easily. When changes need to be made, they can be made much more easily as well. This is part of the reason that it's become such a popular language in the current market. Additionally, Rails doesn't require a separate compiler or other tools that some languages need to make a usable, (and sometimes more importantly) easily testable program
            </p>
            <p>
            	Well, it was a brief overview, but I hope it was helpful! Looking forward to learning more about the intricacies of Rails in the coming weeks. Maybe you'll hear more about it on here!
