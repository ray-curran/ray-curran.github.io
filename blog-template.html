- How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a little more difficult than doing it on my own. I think when you're doing something as basic as a wireframe with someone else, you don't always have the opportunity to take your time and use your own methods. When doing creative tasks, I'm usually a little better working on something, taking some time away, and then coming back to play around with it again. When working with someone else you really have to make sure you're both putting in your thoughts and adapting to each other. 

- Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Yes, I did find it helpful to the development process. It makes the process of actually putting together the html skeleton so much easier and quicker. 

- What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
  Since we were both working together on a single wireframe, we tried to just put the skeleton together without much "guts". Instead of really digging into the details we put pretty basic elements together in boxes and then worked from there. It seemed to work well, but also left us flexibility down the line. 

- What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  Marshall talked a little about the "article" element, which I hadn't dug into too much so far this week.
